Subsequently an initiative was taken by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of Government of India whose motive was to pair different States and Union Territories of India and to ensure that they carry out a structured engagement with one another in the sphere of language, literature, cuisine, festivals, cultural events, tourism etc. Our state Odisha was paired up with Maharashtra. According to the guidelines of MHRD, NIT Rourkela is paired up with VNIT Nagpur for the same. This club will work to organize various events according to the guidelines of MHRD throughout the year and submit a report to MHRD at the end of the year.
